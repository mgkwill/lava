    how to select a ProcessModel of a Process to get started instead of
    formal rules.

    E.g. If there exists a Loihi1 ProcessModel, pick that. Else if there is
    an EMB ProcessModel, pick that. Or Just always pick PyProcessModel.

    This method could also filter for other tags of  ProcessModel such as
    bit-accurate, floting point, etc.

    RunConfig can also specify how many nodes of a certain type will be
    available. This will allows to allocate all RuntimeService processes
    during compilation process. Downside of this is tht we have to decide
    very early about the cluster size or Loihi system type although this
    could in principle be decided in Runtime. But if we only were to decide
    this in Runtime, then we would still have to create specific instances of
    RuntimeService processes and corresponding channel configuration in
    Runtime which is actually a compiler job.
    As a mitigation one could clearly break compiler and Executable
    generation up into stages that can be called separately. Then once could
    still change such configuration details later and repeat the required
    compilation stages or just do them in the first place.
